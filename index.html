                        <p>Yo Bruh,</p>
                        <p>On your special day, I can't help but thank God for placing a friend like you in my life. Despite the distance between Antipolo and Cebu, our Friday Bible studies have been a source of joy and strength for me. Your wisdom, encouragement, and faithfulness have deeply influenced my life. Beyond friendship, you've become a cherished companion on our shared journey of faith.</p>
                        <p>As you celebrate another year of life, know that I am praying for God's continued blessings upon you. May His love and guidance shine brightly on your path, and may our friendship continue to grow stronger despite the miles that separate us. Here's to many more birthdays and moments of shared faith together.</p>
                        <p>"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up."</p>
                        <p>Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (KJV)</p>
                        <p>Happy birthday, Bruh!</p>
                        <p>Warmest regards,</p>
                        <p>Bruh</p>
